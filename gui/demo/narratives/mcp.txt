MCP (Machine Callable Packages) Playground

The MCP interface allows AI assistants and agents to interact with your codebase programmatically.

Available tools include:
- search_graph: Run Cypher queries against the code graph
- path_to: Find relationships between code entities
- similar_code: Find similar code patterns
- summarize_node: Get detailed summaries of code entities

This playground lets you test these tools directly before integrating them with agents or IDE extensions.
