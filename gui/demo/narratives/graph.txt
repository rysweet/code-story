Graph Visualization

The graph view provides an interactive visualization of your codebase. 

Key features:
- 3D visualization of code relationships
- Color-coded nodes for different entity types (files, functions, classes)
- Interactive exploration - click nodes to see details
- Filtering by node type, relationship, or search terms
- Ability to focus on specific parts of the codebase

This visualization helps you understand the structure and relationships in your code at a glance.
