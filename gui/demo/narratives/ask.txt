Ask Questions About Your Code

Code Story allows you to ask natural language questions about your codebase.

Examples of questions you can ask:
- "What are the main components of the system?"
- "How does the error handling work?"
- "What is the purpose of the Neo4jConnector class?"
- "Show me the dependency structure of the CLI module"

The system analyzes your question, searches the knowledge graph, and generates a comprehensive answer with relevant code references.
