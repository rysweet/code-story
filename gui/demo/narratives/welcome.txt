Welcome to the Code Story Demo!

Code Story converts codebases into richly-linked knowledge graphs with natural language summaries. This demo will walk you through the main features of the system.

The GUI provides a visual interface for:
- Configuring connection settings
- Ingesting code repositories
- Exploring the code graph
- Asking questions about the code
- Using the MCP tools

Let's start by configuring the system.
