Code Ingestion

The ingestion process analyzes your codebase to build a knowledge graph. This involves:

1. Scanning the filesystem for code files
2. Analyzing code structure and relationships
3. Generating natural language summaries using AI
4. Creating a graph representation in Neo4j

You can ingest any local or remote Git repository. The process runs as a background job, and you can monitor its progress in real-time.
