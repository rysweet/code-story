Configuration Settings

Before using Code Story, we need to configure connections to:
1. Neo4j graph database - Stores the code knowledge graph
2. OpenAI API - Provides the AI analysis capabilities

The configuration page allows you to set:
- Database connection details
- API keys for AI services
- Processing parameters

These settings can also be provided through environment variables or a configuration file.
