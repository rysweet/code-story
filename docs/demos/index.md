# Code Story Demos

Welcome to the Code Story demo documentation. This section provides comprehensive demonstrations of the Code Story system's capabilities and features.

## Available Demos

- [CLI Demo](./cli_demo.md): Step-by-step demonstration of the command line interface for Code Story.
- [GUI Demo](./gui_demo.md): Interactive showcase of the graphical user interface.
- [MCP Demo](./mcp_demo.md): Demonstration of the Machine Callable Packages (MCP) adapter for agent integration.

## Running the Demos

Each demo includes detailed instructions on how to run and use the Code Story features. The demos are designed to be interactive and provide a hands-on experience with the system.

### Prerequisites

Before running any demos, ensure you have:

1. Installed Code Story according to the [installation guide](../user_guides/installation.md)
2. Set up your environment variables and configuration
3. Have access to a Neo4j database (local or remote)
4. Python 3.11+ installed for CLI and MCP demos
5. Node.js 18+ installed for GUI demo

## Demo Structure

Each demo follows a consistent structure:

1. **Installation**: Instructions on how to install/run the necessary components
2. **Configuration**: Setting up the configuration file and environment
3. **Demonstration**: Step-by-step walkthrough of features
4. **Cleanup**: Instructions for cleaning up after the demo

## Automated Testing

All demos have associated test suites to validate they work as expected. These tests ensure the demos remain functional as the codebase evolves.
