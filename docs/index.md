## Overview

Code Story is a system to convert codebases into richly-linked knowledge graphs with natural-language summaries.

It ingests codebases, analyzes their structure, and produces a knowledge graph where code entities are linked based on their relationships. Each entity is augmented with natural language summaries generated by AI.

## Key Features

- **Multi-language support** for codebase analysis
- **Plugin-based ingestion pipeline** for extensibility
- **Neo4j graph database** with semantic indexing and vector search
- **Interactive 3D visualization** of code relationships
- **Natural language summaries** of code entities and relationships
- **API** for integration with IDEs and other tools
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** support for AI agent integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rysweet/code-story.git
cd code-story

# Create a .env file from the template
cp .env-template .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start the services with the provided script
./infra/scripts/start.sh

# Access the GUI at http://localhost:5173
```

## Components

Code Story is built as a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Configuration Module**: Layered configuration system
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j connector with semantic indexing
- **AI Client**: OpenAI API client with caching and retry logic
- **Ingestion Pipeline**: Plugin-based system for processing code
- **API Service**: FastAPI service exposing graph operations
- **Worker**: Celery worker for async processing
- **MCP Service**: Model Context Protocol server
- **GUI**: React/Redux web interface with 3D visualization
