# CLI Demo Execution Plan - Complete Testing Strategy

This document provides a comprehensive plan for systematically testing the Code Story CLI demo functionality as described in [`docs/demos/cli_demo.md`](docs/demos/cli_demo.md).

## üìã Planning Documents Created

1. **[`CLI_DEMO_TEST_PLAN.md`](CLI_DEMO_TEST_PLAN.md)** - High-level test plan with dependency analysis
2. **[`CLI_DEMO_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`](CLI_DEMO_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md)** - Detailed commands and expected results
3. **[`test_cli_demo_phase1.sh`](test_cli_demo_phase1.sh)** - Executable test script for Phase 1

## üéØ Executive Summary

The CLI demo testing is organized into **9 phases** with **strict dependency ordering** to ensure systematic validation:

### Critical Path Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Phase 1: Infrastructure] --> B[Phase 2: Services]
    B --> C[Phase 3: CLI Commands]
    C --> D[Phase 4: Ingestion]
    D --> E[Phase 5: Queries]
    E --> F[Phase 6: Visualization]
    
    D --> G[Phase 7: Database Mgmt]
    E --> H[Phase 8: Demo Scripts]
    F --> I[Phase 9: Advanced Features]
```

**Key Insight**: All ingestion issues must be resolved before any visualization or query functionality can be tested.

## üöÄ Quick Start - Begin Testing

### Step 1: Run Phase 1 Infrastructure Test
```bash
# Execute the automated Phase 1 test
./test_cli_demo_phase1.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Verify Docker installation and status
- ‚úÖ Check project structure and required files
- ‚úÖ Validate Python and CLI availability
- ‚úÖ Create and configure `.env` file
- ‚úÖ Provide clear pass/fail results with next steps

### Step 2: Based on Phase 1 Results

**If Phase 1 PASSES:**
```bash
# Proceed to manual Phase 2 testing
docker compose up -d neo4j redis
# Then follow CLI_DEMO_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md Phase 2 steps
```

**If Phase 1 FAILS:**
- Review the specific failure messages
- Fix infrastructure issues (Docker, Python, missing files)
- Re-run Phase 1 until it passes

## üìä Testing Phases Overview

| Phase | Focus Area | Dependencies | Priority | Estimated Time |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Infrastructure Setup | None | Critical | 5-10 min |
| 2 | Service Infrastructure | Phase 1 | Critical | 10-15 min |
| 3 | CLI Basic Commands | Phase 2 | High | 5-10 min |
| 4 | Ingestion Pipeline | Phase 3 | High | 15-30 min |
| 5 | Query Features | Phase 4 | High | 10-15 min |
| 6 | Visualization | Phase 5 | Medium | 10-15 min |
| 7 | Database Management | Phase 5 | Medium | 5-10 min |
| 8 | End-to-End Scripts | All Previous | Medium | 20-40 min |
| 9 | Advanced Features | All Previous | Low | 15-30 min |

## üîç Issue Categories & Resolution Strategy

### Critical Issues (Stop Testing Until Fixed)
- **Docker not running**: Service infrastructure cannot start
- **Missing configuration files**: Application cannot initialize
- **CLI installation failures**: Cannot test any functionality
- **Database connection failures**: Core functionality unavailable

### High Priority Issues (Fix Before Demo)
- **Celery worker unhealthy**: Ingestion will fail
- **Service startup failures**: API endpoints unavailable
- **Authentication problems**: Limited functionality access
- **Progress tracking failures**: Poor user experience

### Medium Priority Issues (Fix Before Production)
- **Visualization generation failures**: Limited analytical capability
- **Query performance issues**: Poor user experience
- **Database management failures**: Operational limitations

### Low Priority Issues (Enhancement/Polish)
- **Error message quality**: User experience improvements
- **Command shortcuts**: Convenience features
- **Documentation accuracy**: Alignment with actual behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Workflow

### For Each Failed Test:

1. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Check the specific error message
   - Review dependency chain
   - Validate prerequisites

2. **Apply Targeted Fix**
   - Use troubleshooting commands from [`CLI_DEMO_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`](CLI_DEMO_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md)
   - Focus on the specific component that failed
   - Verify fix with minimal reproduction case

3. **Validate Fix**
   - Re-run the specific failed test
   - Ensure dependent tests still pass
   - Document the resolution

4. **Continue Testing**
   - Proceed to next phase only after current phase passes
   - Maintain strict dependency ordering

```

## üéâ Next Steps After Planning

1. **Start Testing**: Run `./test_cli_demo_phase1.sh`
2. **Address Issues**: Fix any failures using the detailed breakdown
3. **Progress Systematically**: Follow dependency order strictly
4. **Document Results**: Track issues and resolutions
5. **Validate End-to-End**: Ensure complete workflows function

This systematic approach ensures that all CLI demo functionality is thoroughly tested and any issues are identified and resolved in the correct order.
