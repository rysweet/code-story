# Code Story

A system to convert codebases into richly-linked knowledge graphs with natural-language summaries.

## Overview

Code Story ingests codebases, analyzes their structure, and produces a knowledge graph where code entities are linked based on their relationships. Each entity is augmented with natural language summaries generated by AI.

## Features

- Multi-language support for codebase analysis
- Plugin-based ingestion pipeline for extensibility
- Neo4j graph database with semantic indexing and vector search
- Interactive 3D visualization of code relationships
- Natural language summaries of code entities and relationships
- API for integration with IDEs and other tools
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for AI agent integration

## Architecture

Code Story is built as a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Configuration Module**: Layered configuration system
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j connector with semantic indexing
- **AI Client**: OpenAI API client with caching and retry logic
- **Ingestion Pipeline**: Plugin-based system for processing code
- **API Service**: FastAPI service exposing graph operations
- **Worker**: Celery worker for async processing
- **MCP Service**: Model Context Protocol server
- **GUI**: React/Redux web interface with 3D visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Poetry 1.8+
