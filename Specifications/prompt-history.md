## Prompt 6 (May 7, 2025)
**Prompt**: FYI it appears that there is uncommitted work. You are my colleague, a SW engineer, and I expect you to work with me on this software project. You are working independently follwing the instructions that I have carefully written in the ./specs/ folder. As you work you will follow the instructions in the ./.github/copilot-instructions.md file and you will read/implement the software described in the specs in ./specs/Main.md and all of the files linked from Main.md. Start with the Main.md and then the 01-overview/ directory and then move through each subdir and its associated specifications, implementing each in order. As you move through the implementations do not forget to keep the status, prompt_history, and shell_history up to date. Always ensure that the tests and CI are passing before moving on from one module to the next. You can use git to commit your work and can use the gh command to interact with the repo. All work should proceed in a branch prefixed with "msft-". Please continue your work to implement the software described in the specs. If you are unsure of the next step look at the status.md. Ensure you commit between each step. If you have not yet committed the previous step you should. Do not skip tests. When updating the shell_history.md make sure that you include the exact command that you ran on the line after the comment. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)
**Response**:
- Checked for uncommitted changes and committed all manual edits to config, test, and pyproject files.
- Ran linting, type checking, and tests to ensure a clean state.
- Confirmed all tests pass and the workspace is ready for the next module.
- Ready to proceed with the next module as specified in status.md and the project plan.
## Prompt 5 (May 7, 2025)
**Prompt**: please proceed.  (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)
**Response**:
- Updated status.md to reflect completion of TOML/env loading, Azure KeyVault integration, and expanded test coverage for the configuration module.
- Marked configuration module as fully implemented, tested, and documented per specification.
- Confirmed all configuration requirements and tests are complete and passing.
- Ready to proceed to the next module in order.

**Response**:
- Confirmed prompt-history.md and shell_history.md are up to date.
- Read the beginning of 02-scaffolding/scaffolding.md and confirmed directory structure requirements.
- Read the full scaffolding spec and attempted to list all required directories/files.
- Discovered that many required directories (src/, gui/, infra/, tests/, docs/, scripts/, .devcontainer/, etc.) are missing from the workspace.
- Created missing foundational directories and .gitkeep files as per the scaffolding specification.
- Added .env-template, .codestory.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, docker-compose.yaml, and .github/workflows/ci.yml as per scaffolding spec.
- Updated status.md and shell_history.md after each step.
- Next: Continue with remaining scaffolding steps (Poetry, pnpm, devcontainer, Dockerfiles, docs structure, etc.) and verify all requirements in 02-scaffolding/scaffolding.md are met.

## Prompt 4 (May 7, 2025)
**Prompt**: Please continue
**Response**:
- Created .editorconfig, .eslintrc.json, .mypy.ini, .ruff.toml, and updated .gitignore to match canonical scaffolding spec.
- Replaced README.md with canonical version referencing specs and bootstrap script.
- Created scripts/bootstrap.sh and made it executable.
- Updated shell_history.md to log chmod +x scripts/bootstrap.sh.
- Confirmed all foundational scaffolding files now exist.
- Ready to verify and proceed to configuration module per scaffolding spec.

**Response**:
- Read and understood the project instructions and Main.md specification.
- Located and reviewed the .github/copilot-instructions.md for process requirements.
- Searched for prompt-history.md, shell_history.md, and status.md; none existed, so will create them.
- Created prompt-history.md and logged this initial prompt and response summary.
- Will proceed to create shell_history.md and status.md next, then begin implementation with 01-overview/overview.md.

## Prompt 2 (May 7, 2025)
**Prompt**: Please continue
**Response**:
- Created and committed prompt-history.md, shell_history.md, and status.md as required by project process.
- Checked out a new branch 'msft-initial-setup' for all work.
- Read and summarized 01-overview/overview.md and 01-overview/error-handling.md.
- Ready to proceed to the next specification: 02-scaffolding/scaffolding.md.
