# Prompt History

## Prompt 97 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: Proceed with Milestone 6 from the async task-management plan: **Retry & Failure Recovery**.

Scope
1. Configure Celery retry/back-off policies per step; allow max retries and back-off in `pipeline_config.yml`.
2. Update task code to call `self.retry()` on transient errors; ensure idempotency.
3. Persist retry/failure info and expose via status API (`/v1/ingest/{job_id}`) and WebSocket events.
4. Add CLI/GUI visibility for retry counts and last-error message.
5. Tests (unit + integration): simulate transient failures, verify automatic retry and eventual success/failure reporting.
6. Specs/docs: update sections on retry/failure handling.
7. Run all checks/tests before each commit.

ONLY implement this milestone; do not start the next one yet.  
Finish with attempt_completion summarizing the changes and next steps.

**Response**:
- Updated `pipeline_config.yml` to support per-step and global retry/back-off config
- Updated config loader and manager to propagate retry/back-off settings to each step
- Refactored Celery step task to use per-step retry/back-off, call `self.retry()` on transient errors, and persist `retry_count`/`last_error`
- Extended status API, WebSocket, CLI, and GUI models to expose retry/failure info per step
- Added integration test to simulate transient failures and verify retry/failure reporting
- Updated ingestion pipeline spec addendum to document retry/failure handling and visibility
- Fixed all linter and type errors; ran all checks and tests to validate implementation

## Prompt 98 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: Proceed with the remaining milestones in a single continuous effort to fully resolve issue #42:

Milestone 7 – **Scheduling / Delayed Execution**  
1. Add scheduling support (`eta` / `countdown`) to ingestion API & CLI.  
2. Persist schedule metadata; enqueue delayed jobs.  
3. Tests: verify delayed execution works.  
4. Update specs/docs.

Milestone 8 – **Performance Monitoring & Metrics**  
1. Collect task metrics (duration, CPU%, memory MB).  
2. Expose metrics via API `/v1/ingest/resource_status` and Prometheus `/metrics`.  
3. Tests: verify metrics collection & exposure.  
4. Update specs/docs; ensure acceptance criteria met.

Run all checks/tests after each change. When both milestones are complete, use attempt_completion summarizing full issue resolution.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 98 before any code or documentation changes
- Planned stepwise implementation for Milestone 7 (Scheduling/Delayed Execution) and Milestone 8 (Performance Monitoring & Metrics)
- Will update shell history after each command and run all checks/tests after each change
- Will update specs and documentation as part of each milestone

## Prompt 99 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: Continue implementation to fully resolve issue #42.

Remaining milestones to implement and validate:

Milestone 7 – Scheduling / Delayed Execution  
1. Add scheduling support (`eta` / `countdown`) to ingestion API & CLI.  
2. Persist schedule metadata; enqueue delayed jobs only at the scheduled time.  
3. Tests (unit + integration): verify delayed execution works end-to-end.  
4. Update specs/docs.

Milestone 8 – Performance Monitoring & Metrics  
1. Collect task metrics (duration, CPU %, memory MB).  
2. Expose metrics via API `/v1/ingest/resource_status` and Prometheus `/metrics`.  
3. Tests: verify metrics collection & exposure.  
4. Update specs/docs; ensure acceptance criteria met.

Run all checks and tests before each commit.  
When both milestones are complete, use `attempt_completion` summarizing full issue resolution.

**Response**:

1. Create and check out a new branch named fix/mypy-cleanup.  
2. Push the branch to origin and set upstream.  
3. Open a draft PR against main titled “Fix: eliminate all mypy errors” with body “Tracking commits to bring the entire codebase to a clean mypy slate.”  
4. Do not modify any project files yet.  
5. On completion, use attempt_completion summarizing:
   • Branch name
   • Confirmation of push
   • URL (or CLI confirmation) of the newly created draft PR

These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.

- Will summarize the result with branch name, push confirmation, and PR URL/CLI confirmation
## Prompt 101 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• Current branch fix/mypy-cleanup is pushed but has no commits beyond main, blocking PR creation.  
• Goal: add a no-code “starter” commit so we can open the draft PR requested earlier.

Scope – do ONLY the following steps:
1. Run `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: start mypy cleanup"` to create an empty commit.  
2. `git push` to update origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.  
3. Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to open a draft PR against main:  
   • Title: Fix: eliminate all mypy errors  
   • Body: Tracking commits to bring the entire codebase to a clean mypy slate.  
4. On completion, use attempt_completion summarizing:  
   • Confirmation the empty commit was created and pushed  
   • URL (from gh output) of the new draft PR

Do not modify any project files beyond the empty commit.  
These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 101 before any git or CLI actions
- Will create an empty commit on fix/mypy-cleanup with the specified message
- Will push the commit to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup
- Will open a draft PR against main with the specified title and body using the GitHub CLI
- Will summarize completion with confirmation and the PR URL
## Prompt 102 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch fix/mypy-cleanup is checked out.  
• We need a baseline list of MyPy errors to plan fixes.

Scope – do ONLY the following:
1. Execute MyPy across source and tests directories, capturing full output:  
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty src tests > mypy_baseline.txt
2. Produce a brief per-file error count summary:  
   grep -Eo '^[^:]+' mypy_baseline.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > mypy_summary.txt
3. Do NOT commit these files yet; just leave them in the working tree.
4. Use attempt_completion summarizing:  
   • The first 30 lines of mypy_summary.txt (to give a sense of hotspots)  
   • Total number of errors (can be obtained with wc -l mypy_baseline.txt)  
   • Confirmation that both txt files were created.

No code edits besides generating these artifacts.  
These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Ran MyPy across all source and test files, outputting results to mypy_baseline.txt
- Summarized per-file error counts to mypy_summary.txt
- Counted total errors using wc -l mypy_baseline.txt
- Updated shell history after each command
- Did not commit any files; both txt files are present in the working tree
- Will present the first 30 lines of mypy_summary.txt, total error count, and confirmation as requested
## Prompt 103 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch `fix/mypy-cleanup` is active and pushed with a draft PR open.
• The repository contains helper scripts (`fix_mypy_comprehensive.py`, `fix_mypy_errors.py`, etc.) intended to auto-refactor code for MyPy compliance.

Objective: Iteratively run the comprehensive fixer, re-check MyPy, and commit the changes. Continue until MyPy reports zero errors (or the fixer stops reducing the count). All commits land in this single branch/PR.

Scope – for this pass do ONLY:
1. Execute the comprehensive fixer:
   ```bash
   poetry run python fix_mypy_comprehensive.py
   ```
2. Re-run MyPy and capture remaining error count:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes src tests > mypy_after_pass1.txt
   wc -l mypy_after_pass1.txt  # to get count
   ```
3. Stage and commit all modifications produced by the fixer with message:
   ```
   chore: automated mypy cleanup pass 1
   ```
4. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
5. In attempt_completion summarize:
   • Files changed / lines modified (use `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD`).  
   • New MyPy error count.  
   • Whether the count decreased; if errors remain, we will schedule another pass.

Do NOT edit code manually; rely solely on the script’s automated changes for this pass. These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 103 before any code or CLI actions
- Will run the comprehensive MyPy fixer script as instructed
- Will re-run MyPy and capture the new error count
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize files changed, new MyPy error count, and whether the count decreased
## Prompt 104 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch `fix/mypy-cleanup` currently has 1 186 MyPy errors after automated cleanup pass 1.
• Objective: Drive error count to zero within this same branch/PR.

Scope – pass 2:
1. Re-run the comprehensive fixer:
   ```bash
   poetry run python fix_mypy_comprehensive.py
   ```
2. Execute MyPy again:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes src tests > mypy_after_pass2.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_pass2.txt)
   ```
3. Stage & commit all changes:
   ```
   chore: automated mypy cleanup pass 2
   ```
4. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
5. In attempt_completion report:
   • `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` summary  
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS)  
   • Comparison to previous 1 186 figure; indicate if further passes are needed.

No manual edits; rely solely on the script. This message supersedes any conflicting general instructions.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 104 before any code or CLI actions
- Will run the comprehensive MyPy fixer script for pass 2 as instructed
- Will re-run MyPy and capture the new error count to mypy_after_pass2.txt
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize files changed, new MyPy error count, and whether further passes are needed
## Prompt 105 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context: Remaining 1 186 MyPy errors include ≈260 “import-untyped” issues, largely because our internal packages lack `py.typed` markers. Adding these markers will eliminate those errors for every import site (tests + prod).

Scope — do ONLY the following:

1. Create an **empty** file named `py.typed` in each first-party package under `src/`:
   • src/codestory  
   • src/codestory_service  
   • src/codestory_docgrapher  
   • src/codestory_filesystem  
   • src/codestory_mcp  
   • src/codestory_summarizer  
   • src/codestory_blarify  
2. `git add` the new files.
3. Re-run MyPy:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes src tests > mypy_after_pytyped.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_pytyped.txt)
   ```
4. Commit with message:
   ```
   chore: add py.typed markers to first-party packages
   ```
5. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
6. Use attempt_completion summarizing:
   • Confirmation of py.typed files created (list them).  
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS) and reduction versus 1 186 figure.  
   • Indicate next logical focus area if errors remain.

No other code changes.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 105 before any code or CLI actions
- Will create empty `py.typed` files in all listed first-party package directories under `src/`
- Will stage the new files with `git add`
- Will re-run MyPy and capture the new error count
- Will commit and push with the specified message
- Will summarize results, including files created, new error count, and next focus area
## Prompt 106 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• After duplicate-module fix, MyPy still reports 1 249 errors, the bulk coming from:
  – tests.* functions lacking type annotations (no-untyped-def)  
  – import-untyped for 3rd-party libs (celery, msal, etc.)
• Goal: reach zero reported errors without changing code semantics.

Plan for this pass – tame configuration noise:

1. Open `.mypy.ini` and append the following sections:

```
[mypy]
# keep strict for src
disallow_untyped_defs = True
warn_unused_ignores = True

# third-party libs without stubs
[mypy-celery.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True
[mypy-msal.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True
[mypy-neo4j.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True

# relax strict rules in tests
[mypy-tests.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = False
disallow_incomplete_defs = False
warn_return_any = False
```

2. Save the file.

3. Re-run MyPy with the explicit packages command again, capture output:

```bash
poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty \
  -p codestory -p codestory_service -p codestory_docgrapher \
  -p codestory_filesystem -p codestory_mcp -p codestory_summarizer \
  -p codestory_blarify tests > mypy_after_config_tune.txt
ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_config_tune.txt)
```

4. Commit the `.mypy.ini` changes with message:
```
chore: relax mypy rules for tests and ignore missing stubs
```

5. Push to `origin/fix/mypy-cleanup`.

6. Finish with attempt_completion summarizing:
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS) versus previous 1 249.  
   • Confirm that remaining errors (if any) are within src (production) only.  
   • State next step if errors remain.

No code edits beyond `.mypy.ini`.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 106 before any code or CLI actions
- Will append the specified configuration to `.mypy.ini`
- Will re-run MyPy with the explicit packages command and capture output
- Will commit and push `.mypy.ini` with the provided message
- Will summarize new MyPy error count, confirm error locations, and state next step if needed
## Prompt 107 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• Current branch fix/mypy-cleanup; `.mypy.ini` now stricter; 2 378 MyPy errors remain across src and tests.
• A helper script [`nuclear_mypy_fix.py`](nuclear_mypy_fix.py) exists and is designed to add missing `-> None` / parameter annotations to functions (especially in tests) and insert `# type: ignore` where safe, dramatically reducing `no-untyped-def` and similar errors.

Scope – run the nuclear fix and measure impact:

1. Execute the fixer:
   ```bash
   poetry run python nuclear_mypy_fix.py
   ```
2. Re-run MyPy with the explicit package list + tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty \
     -p codestory -p codestory_service -p codestory_docgrapher \
     -p codestory_filesystem -p codestory_mcp -p codestory_summarizer \
     -p codestory_blarify tests > mypy_after_nuclear.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_nuclear.txt)
   ```
3. Stage and commit all modifications with message:
   ```
   chore: nuclear mypy fix pass
   ```
4. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
5. Use attempt_completion summarizing:
   • Files changed / lines modified (use `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD`).  
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS) and delta from 2 378.  
   • List top remaining error codes (first 10 unique codes from output).  
   • Recommend next action (manual tweaks, another script, etc.) if errors remain.

No manual edits besides running the script.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 107 before any code or CLI actions
- Will run the nuclear MyPy fixer script as instructed
- Will re-run MyPy with the explicit package list and capture output/error count
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize files changed, new MyPy error count, error code breakdown, and recommend next steps
## Prompt 108 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch fix/mypy-cleanup. File [`nuclear_mypy_fix.py`](nuclear_mypy_fix.py) exists at repository root (confirmed in VS Code open tabs).  
• Previous attempt reported script missing—likely a path or execution issue.

Scope – verify and run the script:

1. Confirm the script is present by listing it: `ls -l nuclear_mypy_fix.py`.
2. Execute the fixer:  
   ```bash
   poetry run python nuclear_mypy_fix.py
   ```
3. Re-run MyPy with explicit packages + tests:  
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty \
     -p codestory -p codestory_service -p codestory_docgrapher \
     -p codestory_filesystem -p codestory_mcp -p codestory_summarizer \
     -p codestory_blarify tests > mypy_after_nuclear.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_nuclear.txt)
   ```
4. Stage and commit changes produced by the script:  
   ```
   chore: nuclear mypy fix pass
   ```
5. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
6. In attempt_completion include:  
   • `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` summary.  
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS) and delta from previous 2 378.  
   • Top remaining error codes (unique codes from first ~20 lines).  
   • Recommended next action if errors remain.

No manual edits besides running the script.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 108 before any code or CLI actions
- Will confirm presence of `nuclear_mypy_fix.py` at repo root
- Will run the fixer script using Poetry
- Will re-run MyPy with explicit package list and capture output/error count
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize files changed, new MyPy error count, error code breakdown, and recommend next steps
## Prompt 109 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• Branch `fix/mypy-cleanup` is current and pushed.
• Multiple syntax-error fixes landed; we haven’t yet re-measured the type-check status.
Goal for this pass – verify whether **all** MyPy errors are now resolved.

Scope – do ONLY:
1. Run MyPy over the packages and tests (same explicit command) and save output:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty \
     -p codestory -p codestory_service -p codestory_docgrapher \
     -p codestory_filesystem -p codestory_mcp -p codestory_summarizer \
     -p codestory_blarify tests > mypy_final_check.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_final_check.txt)
   ```
2. If $ERRORS equals 0:
   • Commit `mypy_final_check.txt` (optional) with message  
     `docs: record zero-error mypy baseline`.
   • Push, then use attempt_completion summarizing success (zero errors, diff stat).
3. If $ERRORS > 0:
   • Do NOT commit anything yet.
   • Use attempt_completion summarizing:
     – Remaining error count  
     – First 30 lines of `mypy_final_check.txt`  
     – Dominant error codes  
   This will inform next corrective step.

No code edits beyond optionally committing the baseline when clean.
These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 109 before any CLI or MyPy actions
- Will run MyPy with the explicit package list and save output to mypy_final_check.txt
- Will count the number of error lines in the output file
- If error count is zero, will commit and push the baseline file, then summarize success and diff stat
- If error count is nonzero, will not commit, but will summarize error count, first 30 lines, and dominant error codes
- Will update shell history after running the MyPy command
- Will strictly follow the scope and not perform any code edits
## Prompt 110 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• 111 MyPy errors remain, dominated by unused-ignore, import-untyped (kombu), and a handful of dict-item/attr-defined issues.
• A helper script [`final_cleanup.py`](final_cleanup.py) exists; it deletes redundant `# type: ignore` lines and can inject `ignore_missing_imports` stubs in mypy.ini.

Scope – execute final cleanup and retest:

1. Run the cleanup script:
   ```bash
   poetry run python final_cleanup.py
   ```
2. Update `.mypy.ini` to silence kombu stubs:
   Add section  
   ```
   [mypy-kombu.*]
   ignore_missing_imports = True
   ```
3. Re-run MyPy with the same explicit package list + tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty \
     -p codestory -p codestory_service -p codestory_docgrapher \
     -p codestory_filesystem -p codestory_mcp -p codestory_summarizer \
     -p codestory_blarify tests > mypy_after_cleanup.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_cleanup.txt)
   ```
4. Stage and commit all edits with message:
   ```
   chore: final mypy cleanup pass
   ```
5. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
6. In attempt_completion summarize:
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS) and delta from 111.  
   • `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` for this commit.  
   • If $ERRORS == 0, declare cleanup complete.

No manual code edits beyond `.mypy.ini` change; rely on script for file-level fixes.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 110 before any code or CLI actions
- Will run `final_cleanup.py` using Poetry to remove redundant ignores and update stubs
- Will update `.mypy.ini` to silence kombu import errors
- Will re-run MyPy with the explicit package list and capture the new error count
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize new MyPy error count, diff stat, and declare cleanup complete if zero errors remain
## Prompt 111 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• `final_cleanup.py` is present in repository root (visible in VS Code tabs). Prior attempt likely failed due to path or venv issues, not missing file.
• 111 MyPy errors remain, dominated by [unused-ignore], [import-untyped] for kombu, and a handful of dict/attr errors.

Objective: run the final cleanup script, relax kombu import, and re-measure.

Actions – perform EXACTLY:

1. Verify script location: `ls -l ./final_cleanup.py` (root).
2. Execute:  
   ```bash
   poetry run python ./final_cleanup.py
   ```
3. Append kombu ignore section to `.mypy.ini` if not already present:  
   ```
   [mypy-kombu.*]
   ignore_missing_imports = True
   ```
4. Re-run MyPy:  
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty \
     -p codestory -p codestory_service -p codestory_docgrapher \
     -p codestory_filesystem -p codestory_mcp -p codestory_summarizer \
     -p codestory_blarify tests > mypy_after_cleanup.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_cleanup.txt)
   ```
5. Stage and commit all modifications with message:  
   ```
   chore: final mypy cleanup pass
   ```
6. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
7. Use attempt_completion summarizing:  
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS) and delta from 111.  
   • `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` summary for this commit.  
   • If $ERRORS == 0, declare cleanup complete; otherwise list dominant remaining error codes from first 20 lines.

No manual code edits besides `.mypy.ini`.
These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules.

**Response**:
- Logged Prompt 111 before any CLI or code actions
- Will verify presence of `final_cleanup.py` in repo root
- Will run the script using Poetry to remove redundant ignores and update stubs
- Will append kombu ignore section to `.mypy.ini` if missing
- Will re-run MyPy and capture new error count
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize new MyPy error count, diff stat, and declare cleanup complete if zero errors remain
