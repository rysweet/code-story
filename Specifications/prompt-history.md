# Prompt History

## Prompt 97 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: Proceed with Milestone 6 from the async task-management plan: **Retry & Failure Recovery**.

Scope
1. Configure Celery retry/back-off policies per step; allow max retries and back-off in `pipeline_config.yml`.
2. Update task code to call `self.retry()` on transient errors; ensure idempotency.
3. Persist retry/failure info and expose via status API (`/v1/ingest/{job_id}`) and WebSocket events.
4. Add CLI/GUI visibility for retry counts and last-error message.
5. Tests (unit + integration): simulate transient failures, verify automatic retry and eventual success/failure reporting.
6. Specs/docs: update sections on retry/failure handling.
7. Run all checks/tests before each commit.

ONLY implement this milestone; do not start the next one yet.  
Finish with attempt_completion summarizing the changes and next steps.

**Response**:
- Updated `pipeline_config.yml` to support per-step and global retry/back-off config
- Updated config loader and manager to propagate retry/back-off settings to each step
- Refactored Celery step task to use per-step retry/back-off, call `self.retry()` on transient errors, and persist `retry_count`/`last_error`
- Extended status API, WebSocket, CLI, and GUI models to expose retry/failure info per step
- Added integration test to simulate transient failures and verify retry/failure reporting
- Updated ingestion pipeline spec addendum to document retry/failure handling and visibility
- Fixed all linter and type errors; ran all checks and tests to validate implementation

## Prompt 98 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: Proceed with the remaining milestones in a single continuous effort to fully resolve issue #42:

Milestone 7 – **Scheduling / Delayed Execution**  
1. Add scheduling support (`eta` / `countdown`) to ingestion API & CLI.  
2. Persist schedule metadata; enqueue delayed jobs.  
3. Tests: verify delayed execution works.  
4. Update specs/docs.

Milestone 8 – **Performance Monitoring & Metrics**  
1. Collect task metrics (duration, CPU%, memory MB).  
2. Expose metrics via API `/v1/ingest/resource_status` and Prometheus `/metrics`.  
3. Tests: verify metrics collection & exposure.  
4. Update specs/docs; ensure acceptance criteria met.

Run all checks/tests after each change. When both milestones are complete, use attempt_completion summarizing full issue resolution.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 98 before any code or documentation changes
- Planned stepwise implementation for Milestone 7 (Scheduling/Delayed Execution) and Milestone 8 (Performance Monitoring & Metrics)
- Will update shell history after each command and run all checks/tests after each change
- Will update specs and documentation as part of each milestone
- Will use attempt_completion to summarize full issue resolution after both milestones are complete
## Prompt 99 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: Continue implementation to fully resolve issue #42.

Remaining milestones to implement and validate:

Milestone 7 – Scheduling / Delayed Execution  
1. Add scheduling support (`eta` / `countdown`) to ingestion API & CLI.  
2. Persist schedule metadata; enqueue delayed jobs only at the scheduled time.  
3. Tests (unit + integration): verify delayed execution works end-to-end.  
4. Update specs/docs.

Milestone 8 – Performance Monitoring & Metrics  
1. Collect task metrics (duration, CPU %, memory MB).  
2. Expose metrics via API `/v1/ingest/resource_status` and Prometheus `/metrics`.  
3. Tests: verify metrics collection & exposure.  
4. Update specs/docs; ensure acceptance criteria met.

Run all checks and tests before each commit.  
When both milestones are complete, use `attempt_completion` summarizing full issue resolution.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 99 before any code or documentation changes
- Planned stepwise implementation for Milestone 7 (Scheduling/Delayed Execution) and Milestone 8 (Performance Monitoring & Metrics)
- Will update shell history after each command and run all checks/tests after each change
- Will update specs and documentation as part of each milestone

## Prompt 100 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• Repository root: /Users/ryan/src/msec/code-story  
• Current branch presumed up-to-date with main.  
• Goal: create a working branch and a draft PR where we’ll later land mypy-fix commits.

Scope – do ONLY the following:
1. Create and check out a new branch named fix/mypy-cleanup.  
2. Push the branch to origin and set upstream.  
3. Open a draft PR against main titled “Fix: eliminate all mypy errors” with body “Tracking commits to bring the entire codebase to a clean mypy slate.”  
4. Do not modify any project files yet.  
5. On completion, use attempt_completion summarizing:
   • Branch name
   • Confirmation of push
   • URL (or CLI confirmation) of the newly created draft PR

These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 100 before any code or git actions
- Will create and check out a new branch named `fix/mypy-cleanup`
- Will push the branch to origin and set upstream
- Will open a draft PR against `main` with the specified title and body
- Will summarize the result with branch name, push confirmation, and PR URL/CLI confirmation
## Prompt 101 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**: 
Context:
• Current branch fix/mypy-cleanup is pushed but has no commits beyond main, blocking PR creation.  
• Goal: add a no-code “starter” commit so we can open the draft PR requested earlier.

Scope – do ONLY the following steps:
1. Run `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: start mypy cleanup"` to create an empty commit.  
2. `git push` to update origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.  
3. Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to open a draft PR against main:  
   • Title: Fix: eliminate all mypy errors  
   • Body: Tracking commits to bring the entire codebase to a clean mypy slate.  
4. On completion, use attempt_completion summarizing:  
   • Confirmation the empty commit was created and pushed  
   • URL (from gh output) of the new draft PR

Do not modify any project files beyond the empty commit.  
These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 101 before any git or CLI actions
- Will create an empty commit on fix/mypy-cleanup with the specified message
- Will push the commit to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup
- Will open a draft PR against main with the specified title and body using the GitHub CLI
- Will summarize completion with confirmation and the PR URL
## Prompt 102 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch fix/mypy-cleanup is checked out.  
• We need a baseline list of MyPy errors to plan fixes.

Scope – do ONLY the following:
1. Execute MyPy across source and tests directories, capturing full output:  
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty src tests > mypy_baseline.txt
2. Produce a brief per-file error count summary:  
   grep -Eo '^[^:]+' mypy_baseline.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > mypy_summary.txt
3. Do NOT commit these files yet; just leave them in the working tree.
4. Use attempt_completion summarizing:  
   • The first 30 lines of mypy_summary.txt (to give a sense of hotspots)  
   • Total number of errors (can be obtained with wc -l mypy_baseline.txt)  
   • Confirmation that both txt files were created.

No code edits besides generating these artifacts.  
These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Ran MyPy across all source and test files, outputting results to mypy_baseline.txt
- Summarized per-file error counts to mypy_summary.txt
- Counted total errors using wc -l mypy_baseline.txt
- Updated shell history after each command
- Did not commit any files; both txt files are present in the working tree
- Will present the first 30 lines of mypy_summary.txt, total error count, and confirmation as requested
## Prompt 103 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch `fix/mypy-cleanup` is active and pushed with a draft PR open.
• The repository contains helper scripts (`fix_mypy_comprehensive.py`, `fix_mypy_errors.py`, etc.) intended to auto-refactor code for MyPy compliance.

Objective: Iteratively run the comprehensive fixer, re-check MyPy, and commit the changes. Continue until MyPy reports zero errors (or the fixer stops reducing the count). All commits land in this single branch/PR.

Scope – for this pass do ONLY:
1. Execute the comprehensive fixer:
   ```bash
   poetry run python fix_mypy_comprehensive.py
   ```
2. Re-run MyPy and capture remaining error count:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes src tests > mypy_after_pass1.txt
   wc -l mypy_after_pass1.txt  # to get count
   ```
3. Stage and commit all modifications produced by the fixer with message:
   ```
   chore: automated mypy cleanup pass 1
   ```
4. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
5. In attempt_completion summarize:
   • Files changed / lines modified (use `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD`).  
   • New MyPy error count.  
   • Whether the count decreased; if errors remain, we will schedule another pass.

Do NOT edit code manually; rely solely on the script’s automated changes for this pass. These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules for Code mode.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 103 before any code or CLI actions
- Will run the comprehensive MyPy fixer script as instructed
- Will re-run MyPy and capture the new error count
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize files changed, new MyPy error count, and whether the count decreased
## Prompt 104 (May 29, 2025)

**Prompt**:  
Context:
• Branch `fix/mypy-cleanup` currently has 1 186 MyPy errors after automated cleanup pass 1.
• Objective: Drive error count to zero within this same branch/PR.

Scope – pass 2:
1. Re-run the comprehensive fixer:
   ```bash
   poetry run python fix_mypy_comprehensive.py
   ```
2. Execute MyPy again:
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy --show-error-codes src tests > mypy_after_pass2.txt
   ERRORS=$(wc -l < mypy_after_pass2.txt)
   ```
3. Stage & commit all changes:
   ```
   chore: automated mypy cleanup pass 2
   ```
4. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup.
5. In attempt_completion report:
   • `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` summary  
   • New MyPy error count ($ERRORS)  
   • Comparison to previous 1 186 figure; indicate if further passes are needed.

No manual edits; rely solely on the script. This message supersedes any conflicting general instructions.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to log the new user request as Prompt 104 before any code or CLI actions
- Will run the comprehensive MyPy fixer script for pass 2 as instructed
- Will re-run MyPy and capture the new error count to mypy_after_pass2.txt
- Will stage, commit, and push all changes with the specified message
- Will summarize files changed, new MyPy error count, and whether further passes are needed
