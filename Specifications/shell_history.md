## May 29, 2025

- `docker compose build service` - Built the dedicated service image to bake in dependencies and remove code bind-mount, fixing read-only filesystem errors.
- `docker compose up -d service worker redis neo4j` - Started all required containers (service, worker, redis, neo4j) with the new service image and no code bind-mount.
- `docker compose ps` - Checked the status of all containers to confirm they are running and healthy. Noted that codestory-service is not running; neo4j, redis, and worker are healthy.
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_filesystem_ingestion_e2e.py::TestFilesystemIngestionE2E::test_comprehensive_filesystem_ingestion -v -s` - Ran the comprehensive filesystem ingestion integration test. **FAILED**: Timeout waiting for CodeStory services to start; codestory-service container is not running.
- `docker logs codestory-service --tail 200` - Captured the last 200 lines of logs from the codestory-service container to diagnose the startup failure. Revealed an ASGI app loading error: Attribute "app" not found in module "codestory_service.api.service".
- `docker compose build service` - Rebuilt the codestory-service image after correcting the ASGI entrypoint in Dockerfile.service.
- `docker compose up -d service` - Restarted the codestory-service container after fixing the ASGI entrypoint; confirmed it started successfully.
- `docker compose ps` - Checked the status of all containers; codestory-service is up and health check is starting, others are healthy.
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_filesystem_ingestion_e2e.py::TestFilesystemIngestionE2E::test_comprehensive_filesystem_ingestion -v -s` - Ran the comprehensive filesystem ingestion integration test. **FAILED**: FileNotFoundError due to missing parent directories for .git/refs/heads/main in test setup.
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_filesystem_ingestion_e2e.py::TestFilesystemIngestionE2E::test_comprehensive_filesystem_ingestion -v -s` - Re-ran the comprehensive filesystem ingestion integration test. **FAILED**: Timeout (>120s) during service startup in test setup; likely subprocess or container state issue.
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_filesystem_ingestion_e2e.py::TestFilesystemIngestionE2E::test_comprehensive_filesystem_ingestion -v -s` - Re-ran the comprehensive filesystem ingestion integration test. **FAILED**: CLI command failed with return code 2 and no STDERR output.
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_filesystem_ingestion_e2e.py::TestFilesystemIngestionE2E::test_comprehensive_filesystem_ingestion -v -s` - Re-ran the comprehensive filesystem ingestion integration test. **FAILED**: Docker containers stuck in "Created" or "Exited" state; services not healthy.

- `docker compose ps` - Checked the status of all containers; output showed no running or created containers and a warning about the missing CODESTORY_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

- `docker ps -a` - Listed all containers to check for stopped, exited, or created containers after compose up; found codestory-service and codestory-worker in "Created" state, codestory-neo4j and codestory-redis exited (137).

- `docker logs codestory-service --tail 200` - Attempted to collect logs from codestory-service (in "Created" state); no output, indicating the container never started.

- `docker logs codestory-worker --tail 200` - Attempted to collect logs from codestory-worker (in "Created" state); no output, indicating the container never started.

- `docker logs codestory-neo4j --tail 200` - Collected logs from codestory-neo4j (Exited 137); logs show normal startup and successful initialization, no explicit errors, suggesting the container was killed (likely OOM or external signal).

- `docker logs codestory-redis --tail 200` - Collected logs from codestory-redis (Exited 137); logs show normal startup and readiness, no explicit errors, suggesting the container was killed (likely OOM or external signal).
## May 29, 2025
- `docker compose up -d` - Start all services in detached mode after restoring env_file-based configuration.
- `docker compose up -d` - Attempted to start all services; redis and neo4j are healthy, but codestory-worker exited (0) and service is not running.
- `docker compose down` - Stopped and removed all containers to ensure a clean restart with updated .env service hostnames.
- `docker compose up -d` - Start all services in detached mode with the updated .env using service hostnames.

- `docker compose build worker service` - Rebuild worker and service images after restoring env_file-based configuration in compose files.
- `git status -s` - Listed all uncommitted changes in the working directory before staging and committing.
