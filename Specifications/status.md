 # Project Status


## Current Milestone
- Initial setup: Created prompt-history.md, shell_history.md, and status.md as required by project instructions.
- Created foundational directories and .gitkeep files as per scaffolding specification.
- Added .env-template, .codestory.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, docker-compose.yaml, and .github/workflows/ci.yml as per scaffolding spec.
- Added .editorconfig, .eslintrc.json, .mypy.ini, .ruff.toml, canonical .gitignore, and updated README.md per scaffolding spec.
- Created scripts/bootstrap.sh and made it executable.
- All foundational scaffolding files now exist.
- Implemented configuration module (settings, persistence, and test skeletons) per 03-configuration/configuration.md.
- Completed TOML/env loading and Azure KeyVault integration in the configuration module.
- Expanded test coverage for configuration (unit and integration tests).
- Implemented hot-reloading, error handling, and documentation for the configuration module.
- All configuration requirements and tests are complete and passing.
- Configuration module is fully implemented, linted, tested, and documented per specification. All requirements and tests are complete and passing.
- Fixed CI failures: Added/fixed type annotations in config/settings.py and config/writer.py, installed types-toml for mypy compatibility, and re-ran all tests and CI.
- All tests and CI now pass. 
- Implemented the Graph Database Service module (src/codestory/graphdb/) per 04-graph-database/graph-database.md, including Neo4jConnector, schema, exceptions, models, metrics, and tests.
- Fixed all Ruff lint/style errors, type errors, and test failures in the graphdb module. 
- All tests, mypy, and Ruff checks pass for the graphdb module and the project as a whole.
- Ready to proceed to the next module: AI Client (05-ai-client/ai-client.md).

## Outstanding Tasks
- Implement and test each module in order as specified in Main.md and its linked specifications.
- Keep this file, prompt-history.md, and shell_history.md up to date after every step.
- Ensure all tests and CI pass before moving to the next module.

## Blockers
- None at this time.

## Notes
- All work is to be performed in a branch prefixed with "msft-".
- All shell commands (except git commit/add) must be logged in shell_history.md and committed after each change.
- Prompt history must be updated after every user interaction.
