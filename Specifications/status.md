# Project Status

## Current Milestone
- Initial setup: Created prompt-history.md, shell_history.md, and status.md as required by project instructions.
- Created foundational directories and .gitkeep files as per scaffolding specification.
- Added .env-template, .codestory.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, docker-compose.yaml, and .github/workflows/ci.yml as per scaffolding spec.
- Added .editorconfig, .eslintrc.json, .mypy.ini, .ruff.toml, canonical .gitignore, and updated README.md per scaffolding spec.
- Created scripts/bootstrap.sh and made it executable.
- All foundational scaffolding files now exist.
- Next: Verify scaffolding, then proceed to implement the configuration module as specified in 03-configuration/configuration.md.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Implement and test each module in order as specified in Main.md and its linked specifications.
- Keep this file, prompt-history.md, and shell_history.md up to date after every step.
- Ensure all tests and CI pass before moving to the next module.

## Blockers
- None at this time.

## Notes
- All work is to be performed in a branch prefixed with "msft-".
- All shell commands (except git commit/add) must be logged in shell_history.md and committed after each change.
- Prompt history must be updated after every user interaction.
