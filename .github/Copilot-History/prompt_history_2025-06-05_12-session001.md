# Prompt History - Session 2025-06-05_12-session001

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-05)
**Prompt**: Examine the specifications for the Neo4j connector in the CodeStory project and ensure they are updated to accurately match the current implementation. Continue to iterate and refine the specification as needed to ensure full alignment with the codebase.

**Response**: 
- Read and analyzed the current Neo4j connector specification in `specs/04-graph-database/graph-database.md`
- Thoroughly examined the actual implementation in `src/codestory/graphdb/neo4j_connector.py`
- Inspected related modules: `schema.py`, `metrics.py`, and `exceptions.py`
- Compared specification with implementation to identify outdated or missing details
- Updated the specification to synchronize Docker Compose configuration with actual deployment
- Clarified plugin installation process using `NEO4J_PLUGINS` environment variable
- Added details about schema auto-initialization in the factory function
- Updated method signatures and configuration options to match implementation
- Enhanced error handling documentation to reflect actual exception constructors
- Added new section summarizing current implementation status and architectural decisions
- Ensured all documented features, signatures, and behaviors match the current codebase

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-05)
**Prompt**: Please continue

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history to document the completed work on Neo4j connector specification
- Provided summary of accomplishments and current status
- Neo4j connector specification is now fully synchronized with the implementation
- All major sections updated including factory function, connector interface, vector search, error handling, metrics, Docker configuration, and user stories
- Specification accurately reflects current capabilities and architectural decisions of the connector
