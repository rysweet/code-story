## May 29, 2025 (Devcontainer Fix Implementation)

```bash
chmod +x /Users/ryan/src/msec/cb2/code-story/.devcontainer/setup.sh
```
- Made the devcontainer setup script executable to enable proper initialization in GitHub Codespaces

```bash
rm /Users/ryan/src/msec/cb2/code-story/.devcontainer/docker-compose.extend.yml
```
- Removed docker-compose.extend.yml since we're switching to a simplified devcontainer setup that doesn't rely on docker-compose integration
