## Prompt 1 (2025-06-04)
- **Prompt**: 1) please cleanup any prior containers. 2) please continue - each test must create/destroy the rsources it requires instead of relying upon a global set of preconditions. DO NOT SKP TESTS. DO NOT IGNORE WARNINGS. you do not need to hurry or rush, you can take your time to come up with the correct implementation. please continue this task - we are working on completing fixing of all of the tests. 1) do not mock services in integration tests, 2) integration tests must contain al of their setup and cleanup without relying upon external preconditions. 3) in general tests should not be skipped. 4) when running the tests, run all unit tests first. once all unit tests are passin, then run integration tests, do not wait for all the tests to run, as soon as you have a single failure, stop, then reason carefully about how to fix it, then go back to finding the next test that is failing. Do not ignore warnings - go ahead and fix those as well. 5) keep a running list of tests to be fixed in Specificatons/status.md. 6) make sure you are always using the correct venv with python and pytest - use "uv" to ensure. 7) please don't stop after each step - just continue on until there are no longer any failures or warnings in the whole test suite. DO NOT STOP OR MARK YOUR TASK COMPLETED UNTIL ALL TESTS ARE GREEN AND NOT SKIPPED.  DO NOT IGNORE WARNINGS AND DO NOT INTRODUCE ANY MOCKS OR DUMMY INTERFACES. INVESTIGATE THE status.md to find the analysis about Dummy and Mock interfaces and follow-up by removing ALL Dummy and mock interfaces from all integration tests. It is VERY important that the integration tests validate the capabilities of the service correctly, and do not compromise or take shortcuts. your job is at risk if you do not follow all of these instructions.
