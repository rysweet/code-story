# Prompt History - 2025-05-30 07:52 Session 1

## Prompt 1 (2025-05-30 07:52)
**Prompt**: Phase 2 target: src/codestory/graphdb/metrics.py - This file still triggers multiple MyPy errors ([attr-defined], [assignment], missing return types). Required work: 1. Add precise type annotations to every public function/class in metrics.py. 2. Remove unused or redundant "# type: ignore" comments. 3. Ensure no bracket-token leftovers. 4. Focused check with mypy. 5. Commit metrics.py + mypy_metrics.txt. 6. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup and attempt_completion.

**Response**: 
- Creating prompt history file and examining metrics.py file
- Will add precise type annotations for prometheus_client types
- Remove redundant type ignores and ensure clean mypy output
- Run focused mypy check and commit changes
## Prompt 2 (2025-06-03 21:06)
**Prompt**: Implement real‐service fixtures so cancellation integration tests pass with full async flow.

**Response**:
- Will extend tests/integration/conftest.py with a session-scoped celery_worker_container fixture using docker-py and Redis dependency
- Will ensure Celery eager patch is disabled for integration tests
- Will run cancellation integration tests with fail-fast and capture results
- Will update Specifications/status.md with test outcomes and diagnosis if needed
- Will commit all changes and summarize results in attempt_completion
## Prompt 3 (2025-06-04 11:19)
**Prompt**: 
Subtask – Bring all tests to green with no skips, mocks, or warnings
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Context
• The repository resides at /Users/ryan/src/msec/code-story  
• User demands:  
  1. Clean up any previously-running containers.  
  2. Unit tests must pass first; then integration tests.  
  3. Stop on the first failure, reason, fix, re-run.  
  4. Do NOT mock services in integration tests; remove any Dummy/Mock interfaces.  
  5. Each integration test must create/destroy all resources it needs (no global preconditions).  
  6. Do NOT skip tests.  
  7. Fix all warnings.  
  8. Maintain a running list of remaining failing/​problematic tests in [`Specifications/status.md`](Specifications/status.md).  
  9. Always use the correct Python venv via `uv`.  

Scope (do not exceed)
A. Perform full container cleanup.  
   • `docker compose down --remove-orphans --volumes --timeout 0`  
   • `docker system prune -af --volumes` (only if safe)  
B. Ensure venv/​deps via `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
C. Iteratively run tests:  
   1. `pytest -m "not integration"` (unit) –stop-on-first-fail (`-x`).  
   2. Fix the failure (code or test), re-run.  
   3. When unit suite is green & warning-free, run full integration suite:  
      `pytest tests/integration -x`.  
D. For each failure or warning:  
   • Analyse root cause.  
   • Remove mocks/​dummies from integration tests; replace with real service setup (Neo4j, Docker network, etc.).  
   • Add per-test setup/​teardown fixtures so tests are resource-isolated and self-contained.  
   • Update `Specifications/status.md` with a bullet list: test path, failure reason, fix status.  
E. Continue until every test in the repository (unit + integration + CLI/GUI) passes with zero warnings and no skips.

Explicit rules for this subtask
• NEVER introduce new mocks/​dummies.  
• NEVER skip or xfail a test.  
• ALWAYS fix or delete deprecated fixtures causing warnings.  
• If a global fixture leaks state across tests, refactor into per-test fixtures with proper teardown.  
• If a test depends on a running service, spin it up inside the test or fixture and tear it down after.  
• Update any Docker compose, scripts, or fixtures to support isolated runs.  
• Keep commits small and focused; update `status.md` after each failing test is handled.  
• Feel free to add helper utilities/​fixtures under `tests/` or `src/` where appropriate.

Completion criteria
• `pytest -q` across entire repo exits 0 with zero warnings, zero skips.  
• `Specifications/status.md` records “All tests passing – no remaining issues”.  
• All Dummy/Mock interfaces have been removed from integration tests.  
• Proper per-test resource clean-up verified.  

Deliverable
When *everything* above is satisfied, run:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Concise summary of all fixes, major refactors, removed mocks, new fixtures, and confirmation that the entire test suite is green with no skips/​warnings. Include the final contents of Specifications/status.md.
</result>
<command>pytest -q</command>
</attempt_completion>

DO NOT call `attempt_completion` until the suite is fully green.  
These instructions supersede any general guidelines of code-mode. Work only within this scope.

**Response**:
- Appending this prompt and summary to prompt history as Prompt 3
- Will perform full Docker/container cleanup as first step
- Will update shell history after each command
- Will ensure Python venv and dependencies are correct via `uv`
- Will run unit tests with fail-fast, fix failures/warnings iteratively, updating status.md
- Will proceed to integration tests only after unit tests are green and warning-free
- Will remove all mocks/skips, refactor fixtures for isolation, and ensure per-test resource cleanup
- Will keep status.md up to date with all failures and fixes
- Will not call attempt_completion until all tests are green, warning-free, and status.md is finalized
