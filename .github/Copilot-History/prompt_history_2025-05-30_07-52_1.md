## Prompt 1 (2025-05-30 07:52)
**Prompt**: Phase 2 target: src/codestory/graphdb/metrics.py - This file still triggers multiple MyPy errors ([attr-defined], [assignment], missing return types). Required work: 1. Add precise type annotations to every public function/class in metrics.py. 2. Remove unused or redundant "# type: ignore" comments. 3. Ensure no bracket-token leftovers. 4. Focused check with mypy. 5. Commit metrics.py + mypy_metrics.txt. 6. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup and attempt_completion.

**Response**: 
- Creating prompt history file and examining metrics.py file
- Will add precise type annotations for prometheus_client types
- Remove redundant type ignores and ensure clean mypy output
- Run focused mypy check and commit changes
## Prompt 2 (2025-06-03 21:06)
**Prompt**: Implement real‚Äêservice fixtures so cancellation integration tests pass with full async flow.

**Response**:
- Will extend tests/integration/conftest.py with a session-scoped celery_worker_container fixture using docker-py and Redis dependency
- Will ensure Celery eager patch is disabled for integration tests
- Will run cancellation integration tests with fail-fast and capture results
- Will update Specifications/status.md with test outcomes and diagnosis if needed
- Will commit all changes and summarize results in attempt_completion
