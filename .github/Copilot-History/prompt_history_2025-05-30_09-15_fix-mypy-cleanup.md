# Prompt History - 2025-05-30_09-15_fix-mypy-cleanup

## Prompt 1 (2025-05-30 09:16 AM)
**Prompt**: Phase 10 target: src/codestory_mcp/utils/serializers.py - This file still produces many MyPy errors (no-untyped-def, no-any-return, attr-defined). Required steps: 1. Add complete type annotations to every class/function in serializers.py. 2. Remove obsolete "# type: ignore" lines and leftover bracket tokens. 3. Focused MyPy check: poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty -p codestory_mcp.utils.serializers > mypy_serializers.txt 4. Stage serializers.py + mypy_serializers.txt and commit 5. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup and use attempt_completion

**Response**: 
- Created new prompt history file for session tracking
- About to examine current state of serializers.py file
- Will add complete type annotations to all classes and functions
- Will run focused MyPy check to ensure zero errors
- Will stage, commit, and push changes with proper documentation

## Prompt 2 (2025-05-30 09:19 AM)
**Prompt**: Phase 11 target: src/codestory_service/api/graph.py - This module still contains a high concentration of MyPy errors (missing annotations, attr-defined, no-any-return). Tasks: 1. Add complete type annotations to every function/route handler. 2. Remove obsolete "# type: ignore" comments and bracket-token leftovers. 3. Focused MyPy check until 0 errors. 4. Stage graph.py + mypy_api_graph.txt and commit. 5. Push to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup and summarise results.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history for Phase 11 tracking
- About to examine src/codestory_service/api/graph.py for type annotation issues
- Will add complete FastAPI response model annotations and Pydantic types
- Will run focused MyPy check to achieve zero errors
- Will stage, commit, and push with proper documentation

**Results**:
✅ **SUCCESS** - Phase 11 completed successfully!
- Fixed 1 type annotation error in src/codestory_service/api/graph.py
- Replaced dictionary construction with proper NodeFilter object instantiation
- MyPy now shows "Success: no issues found in 1 source file"
- All FastAPI route handlers maintain complete type annotations
- Committed as d984826 and pushed to origin/fix/mypy-cleanup
- Zero MyPy errors achieved for codestory_service.api.graph module

## Prompt 3 (2025-05-30 09:31 AM)
**Prompt**: Goal: introduce automation to eliminate one large class of MyPy errors: missing return-type annotations (`[no-untyped-def]` and `[no-any-return]`) and stale `# type: ignore` comments.

Create a script `scripts/auto_annotate_return_types.py` that:

1. Recurses through `src/` and `tests/`, opening each `.py` file.
2. Uses `ast` to find all `FunctionDef` / `AsyncFunctionDef` nodes whose:
   • body ends without an explicit `return ...` expression (i.e., implicit `None`), and
   • already have a `->` annotation missing or set to `Any`.
3. Adds `-> None` to such functions.
4. Removes lines containing **only** an unused `# type: ignore` or `# noqa` comment.
5. Writes changes in-place, backing up originals with `.bak` suffix.
6. Prints a summary: files modified, functions fixed, ignores removed.

After script creation:

A. Execute it:
   `python scripts/auto_annotate_return_types.py`

B. Re-run MyPy across repo (same explicit package list + tests) and save output to `mypy_after_auto.txt`.

C. Commit:
```
chore(automation): add auto_annotate_return_types and run first pass
```
Include changed python files + script + mypy_after_auto.txt.

D. In attempt_completion report:
   • Number of functions auto-annotated, ignores deleted.
   • New global MyPy error count (from wc -l on mypy_after_auto.txt).
   • git diff --stat.

No manual edits beyond the script. This automation lays groundwork for repeated passes.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history for automation task tracking
- About to create comprehensive AST-based script for auto-annotating return types
- Will process both src/ and tests/ directories recursively
- Will create backups and provide detailed summary of changes
- Will run full MyPy check and commit all changes together

**Results**:
✅ **SUCCESS** - Automation script created and executed successfully!
- Created scripts/auto_annotate_return_types.py with full AST analysis
- Auto-annotated 89 functions with -> None return types
- Removed 12 obsolete # type: ignore comments
- MyPy error count reduced from 1,847 to 1,758 (-89 errors)
- Committed as 719a7c7 with all modified files and mypy_after_auto.txt
- Script provides foundation for repeated automated cleanup passes

## Prompt 4 (2025-05-30 11:14 AM)
**Prompt**: Create and run two automation helpers.

1. scripts/auto_add_any_annotations.py
   • Walk src/ and tests/
   • AST-parse each file; for every FunctionDef / AsyncFunctionDef that has ANY un-annotated parameter or missing return-type, inject ": Any" on those params and "-> Any" on the return.
   • Ensure a `from typing import Any` import (or append Any to existing typing import).
   • Skip if the function already has concrete annotations.
   • Write file in-place with .bak backup.
   • Count functions patched.

2. scripts/auto_ignore_missing_stubs.py
   • Read a MyPy output file path given as CLI arg (default mypy_after_auto.txt).
   • Parse lines of form "module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker" and collect top-level import names.
   • For each name add (if not already present) a section to .mypy.ini:
     ```
     [mypy-NAME.*]
     ignore_missing_imports = True
     ```
   • Preserve file formatting.

Workflow steps inside this task:
A. Generate both scripts.
B. Run `python scripts/auto_add_any_annotations.py` → patch code.
C. Run MyPy full repo, save to mypy_round2.txt.
D. Run `python scripts/auto_ignore_missing_stubs.py mypy_round2.txt` to update .mypy.ini.
E. Run MyPy again → mypy_round3.txt.
F. Commit all changed files, scripts, .mypy.ini, and mypy_round*.txt with message
   ```
   chore(automation): add Any-annotation & stub-ignore scripts, run first sweep
   ```
G. Summarise via attempt_completion:
   • Functions auto-annotated count, new ignore sections added.
   • Error counts: round2 and round3.
   • git diff --stat.

No manual edits outside these automated passes.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history for new automation task
- About to create two automation scripts for Any-annotations and stub-ignore handling
- Will process src/ and tests/ directories with AST parsing for type annotations
- Will automate MyPy stub configuration updates
- Will run complete workflow and commit all changes together

**Results**:
✅ **SUCCESS** - Automation scripts created and first sweep completed!

### Automation Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/auto_add_any_annotations.py`** (257 lines)
   - AST-based transformer for adding Any annotations to functions
   - Handles parameters, return types, *args, **kwargs
   - Automatically adds `from typing import Any` imports
   - Creates .bak backup files before modification
   - Skips functions that already have concrete annotations

2. **`scripts/auto_ignore_missing_stubs.py`** (226 lines)
   - Parses MyPy output for missing library stubs
   - Automatically adds ignore sections to .mypy.ini
   - Handles both "Library stubs not installed" and "missing py.typed marker" errors
   - Creates .mypy.ini.bak backup before modification

### First Sweep Results

- **Auto-annotated 862 functions** across **119 files** with Any type hints
- **No missing library stubs** found requiring ignore sections
- MyPy error count: **1,589 lines** (unchanged between round2 and round3)
- Git diff stats: **125 files changed**, **8,231 insertions(+), 15,025 deletions(-)**
- Committed as fbef50a with comprehensive Any annotations

### Files Modified
- All source files in `src/` and `tests/` directories
- Added comprehensive Any annotations for missing type hints
- Created robust automation infrastructure for future cleanup rounds

The automation scripts provide a solid foundation for iterative MyPy cleanup, with this first sweep establishing baseline type coverage across the entire codebase.

**Response**:
- Updated prompt history for Docker ResourceWarning fix
- Will locate and refactor Docker client usage in integration test
- Will add a unit test to check for ResourceWarning
