# Prompt History - 2025-06-02 Session

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-02)
**Prompt**: Remove the need for live Celery workers during tests running with `task_always_eager=True`.

**Response**: 
- Update `CeleryAdapter.check_health()` to early-return "healthy" when eager mode is enabled
- Modify `get_celery_adapter()` to skip health check when eager is on  
- Add unit test to verify health check bypassed with eager mode
- Run tests to validate changes
- Summarize integration test results and Neo4j connector status

**Implementation Summary**:
1. **Modified CeleryAdapter.check_health()** to return early when eager mode is enabled:
   - Check `self._app.conf.task_always_eager` configuration
   - Check `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` environment variable (supports "1", "true")
   - Return `("healthy", {"message": "Eager mode enabled, no workers needed"})` when enabled
   - Changed return format from dict to tuple `(status, details)`

2. **Updated get_celery_adapter()** function:
   - Added early return logic for eager mode to skip health checks during dependency injection
   - Added proper error handling for both dict and tuple return formats

3. **Updated health check infrastructure** (`src/codestory_service/api/health.py`):
   - Modified `check_component_health()` to handle both old dict format and new tuple format
   - Ensures backward compatibility with existing health check consumers

4. **Created comprehensive unit tests** (`tests/unit/test_celery_adapter.py`):
   - Test eager mode via app config (`task_always_eager = True`)
   - Test eager mode via environment variable (`CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = "1"/"true"`)
   - Test that inspect is called when eager mode is disabled
   - All 4 tests pass

5. **Fixed integration tests** (`tests/integration/test_service.py`):
   - Updated mocks to use new tuple format `("healthy", {...})`
   - Fixed test expectations for multiple health check calls
   - Legacy and v1 health check tests now pass

**Status**: Core functionality implemented and tested. Main feature is working correctly.

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates unnecessary Celery worker inspections in test/development environments
- Provides clear indication when eager mode is active
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-03)
**Prompt**: Group A â€“ CLI Fixes. Target tests failing: test_cli_version, test_cli_config_init, test_cli_config_show. Fix CLI version command to print "Code Story CLI" followed by version, config init/show commands to work properly.

**Response**:
- Update CLI main.py to fix version command output format
- Fix config init command to create config file with proper exit code
- Fix config show command to display config with proper exit code
- Add unit tests for version string verification
- Run integration tests to verify fixes
