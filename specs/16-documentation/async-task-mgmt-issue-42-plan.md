This file has been superseded. The async operation management and task control plan has been fully integrated into the main specifications:

- [`specs/06-ingestion-pipeline/ingestion-pipeline.md`](specs/06-ingestion-pipeline/ingestion-pipeline.md)
- [`specs/11-code-story-service/code-story-service.md`](specs/11-code-story-service/code-story-service.md)
- [`specs/Main.md`](specs/Main.md)
- [`specs/Backlog.md`](specs/Backlog.md)

Please refer to those files for the current, canonical specification.
