# Ingestion Pipeline Implementation

## Summary
This PR implements the complete ingestion pipeline for Code Story, including:

- Core pipeline orchestration framework with plugin-based step discovery
- Four specialized workflow steps:
  - FileSystemStep for repository structure analysis
  - BlarifyStep for code parsing and AST generation
  - SummarizerStep for generating natural language summaries
  - DocumentationGrapherStep for extracting documentation knowledge graphs
- Comprehensive integration tests for the full pipeline
- Parallel processing capability with configurable concurrency
- Progress tracking and detailed status reporting
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Architecture

The ingestion pipeline follows a modular, plugin-based architecture:

```
src/codestory/ingestion_pipeline/  # Core pipeline framework
├── manager.py                     # PipelineManager for orchestration
├── step.py                        # PipelineStep interface
├── tasks.py                       # Celery task definitions
└── worker.py                      # Worker process

src/codestory_filesystem/         # FileSystem step implementation
src/codestory_blarify/            # Blarify step implementation
src/codestory_summarizer/         # Summarizer step implementation
src/codestory_docgrapher/         # Documentation Grapher implementation
```

The architecture enables:
1. Dynamic discovery of workflow steps via entry points
2. Distributed processing with Celery for scalability
3. Parallel execution with configurable concurrency limits
4. Dependency tracking between steps
5. Real-time progress monitoring

## Key Features

### Pipeline Manager

- Discovers available workflow steps using entry points
- Tracks dependencies between steps and ensures correct execution order
- Monitors progress and status across all steps
- Provides job control (start, stop, cancel)
- Handles error recovery and reporting

### Workflow Steps

Each step implements the `PipelineStep` interface and provides:

- `run()` - Starts the step's processing
- `status()` - Reports progress and current state
- `stop()` - Cleanly stops processing
- `cancel()` - Immediately terminates processing
- `ingestion_update()` - Updates existing data incrementally

### FileSystem Step

- Traverses repository directories and identifies files
- Creates a graph representation of the filesystem structure
- Handles exclusion patterns to skip irrelevant files
- Stores relationships between files, directories, and the repository

### Blarify Step

- Runs Blarify in a Docker container for isolated execution
- Parses code and extracts Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Creates symbol bindings for code elements
- Stores AST nodes and relationships in Neo4j

### Summarizer Step

- Builds a dependency graph of code elements
- Processes nodes from leaves to root in parallel
- Generates natural language summaries using specialized prompts
- Stores summaries with links to the original code elements

### Documentation Grapher Step

- Locates documentation files (README, markdown, docstrings)
- Parses documentation using specialized parsers
- Extracts entities and relationships from documentation
- Links documentation entities to relevant code elements
- Creates a knowledge graph of documentation

## Integration Tests

The PR includes comprehensive integration tests:

- Individual step tests with realistic sample repositories
- Full pipeline tests verifying proper orchestration
- Dependency resolution tests ensuring correct execution order
- Progress tracking tests verifying accurate progress reporting
- Error handling tests validating recovery mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced dependency analysis for more efficient parallel processing
- Caching of intermediate results for faster incremental updates
- Enhanced error recovery with automatic retries
- More specialized parsers for additional documentation formats
- Integration with observability tools for monitoring and alerting

## Usage Example

```python
from src.codestory.ingestion_pipeline.manager import PipelineManager

# Create pipeline manager
manager = PipelineManager()

# Run the full pipeline
job_id = manager.start_job(
    repository_path="/path/to/repository",
    steps=["filesystem", "blarify", "summarizer", "documentation_grapher"],
    config={
        "ignore_patterns": [".git/", "__pycache__/"],
        "max_concurrency": 5
    }
)

# Check job status
status = manager.get_job_status(job_id)
print(f"Progress: {status['progress']}%")
```
