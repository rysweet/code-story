# Addendum to FileSystem Step Specification

## A.1 FileSystem Step Improvements

Based on implementation experience, several critical improvements have been made to the FileSystem Step:

### A.1.1 Multiple Neo4j Connection Strategy

A key improvement is the implementation of a fallback connection strategy that tries multiple connection configurations when accessing Neo4j:

```python
# Try multiple Neo4j connection configurations
neo4j = None
errors = []

# Get settings for the default configuration
settings = get_settings()
logger.info(f"Current Neo4j settings from config: uri={settings.neo4j.uri}, database={settings.neo4j.database}")

# Different ways to connect to Neo4j
connection_params = [
    # Default from settings
    {
        "uri": settings.neo4j.uri,
        "username": settings.neo4j.username,
        "password": settings.neo4j.password.get_secret_value(),
        "database": settings.neo4j.database,
    },
    # Container hostname connection
    {
        "uri": "bolt://neo4j:7687",
        "username": "neo4j",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "neo4j",
    },
    # Localhost connection (for main instance)
    {
        "uri": "bolt://localhost:7689",  # Port from docker-compose.yml
        "username": "neo4j",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "neo4j",
    },
    # Localhost test connection
    {
        "uri": "bolt://localhost:7688",  # Port from docker-compose.test.yml
        "username": "neo4j",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "testdb",
    }
]

# Try each connection configuration until one works
for i, params in enumerate(connection_params):
    try:
        logger.info(f"Trying Neo4j connection {i+1}/{len(connection_params)}: {params['uri']}")
        neo4j = Neo4jConnector(**params)
        
        # Test the connection with a simple query
        test_result = neo4j.execute_query("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as count LIMIT 1")
        logger.info(f"Neo4j connection successful: {test_result}")
        
        # If we get here, the connection is working
        break
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Neo4j connection {i+1} failed: {e}")
        errors.append(f"Connection {i+1} ({params['uri']}): {e}")
        if neo4j:
            try:
                neo4j.close()
            except:
                pass
        neo4j = None
```

This approach ensures:
- Greater reliability when connecting from different environments
- Automatic adaptation to different deployment scenarios
- Graceful handling of connection failures with detailed error reporting
- Better user experience with minimal configuration requirements

### A.1.2 Idempotent Graph Operations with MERGE

All Neo4j operations have been refactored to use MERGE instead of CREATE for idempotent node creation:

```python
# Repository node
repo_query = """
MERGE (r:Repository {path: $props.path})
SET r.name = $props.name
RETURN r
"""

# Directory node
dir_query = """
MERGE (d:Directory {path: $props.path})
SET d.name = $props.name
RETURN d
"""

# File node
file_query = """
MERGE (f:File {path: $props.path})
SET f.name = $props.name,
    f.extension = $props.extension,
    f.size = $props.size,
    f.modified = $props.modified
RETURN f
"""

# Relationships
rel_query = """
MATCH (r:Repository {path: $repo_path})
MATCH (f:File {path: $file_path})
MERGE (r)-[rel:CONTAINS]->(f)
RETURN rel
"""
```

This approach provides:
- Ability to run filesystem step multiple times without errors or duplicated nodes
- Graceful handling of pre-existing nodes
- Simplified error handling and recovery logic
- Support for incremental updates when files change

### A.1.3 Unlimited Depth Traversal

The filesystem step now explicitly supports unlimited depth traversal of repositories, removing arbitrary limitations:

```python
# Log depth setting but don't limit it
logger.info(f"Using repository traversal depth: {max_depth} (unlimited if None)")

# During traversal, check but don't enforce depth limit
if max_depth is not None:
    rel_path = os.path.relpath(current_dir, repository_path)
    if rel_path != "." and rel_path.count(os.sep) >= max_depth:
        print(f"  Skipping directory due to depth limit: {rel_path}")
        dirs.clear()  # Don't descend further
        continue
```

This ensures:
- Complete repository ingestion regardless of directory nesting
- Ability to process large, complex repositories
- Proper handling of monorepos with deep directory structures

### A.1.4 Enhanced Progress Reporting

Progress reporting has been enhanced for better user feedback:

```python
# Report progress more frequently (every 10 files)
if file_count % 10 == 0:
    logger.info(f"Progress: {file_count} files, {dir_count} directories")
    try:
        self.update_state(
            state="PROGRESS",
            meta={
                "progress": None,  # Can't know total
                "message": f"Processed {file_count} files, {dir_count} directories",
                "file_count": file_count,
                "dir_count": dir_count,
            },
        )
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error updating progress state: {e}")
        
# Add progress tracking for directories too
if dir_count % 10 == 0 and dir_count > 0:
    logger.info(f"Directory progress: {dir_count} directories processed")
```

This provides:
- More detailed feedback during ingestion
- More frequent progress updates for large repositories
- Better monitoring of long-running ingestion tasks
- Enhanced error diagnostics during processing
